# last-star-timestamp column on your private leaderboards

Here's a script for showing the time of last star on your private leaderboards. I've tried not to mess up the minimalist aesthetic of the website. It looks like this (before/after):

![last-star-ts-userscript-before-after](before-after.gif)

There are no background API requests, the time of last star information is already there in the document, although not visible by default. The userscript just adds a new column into the table to display that information.

To get this:

- Install [tampermonkey extension](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) if you don't have it already
- Click the raw button on ``leaderboard-star-ts.user.js`` or visit the direct link: https://github.com/wimglenn/userscripts/raw/master/adventofcode.com/leaderboard-star-ts.user.js
- A tampermonkey dialog should appear, on which you can click "Install"

_Note: the extra column is only available when the ``[Ordering]`` mode is using ``?order=stars``._
